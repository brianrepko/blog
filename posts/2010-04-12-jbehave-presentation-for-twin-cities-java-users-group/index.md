Finally finished the JBehave presentation for tonight's Twin Cities Java Users Group. You can find the PPT and source code at the LearnThinkCode [website](http://www.learnthinkcode.com). Any and all feedback is welcome.

In the end, I really think that this is the year that Agile testing via executable requirements will take off and I do think that JBehave can be a part of that. There are some key things to work out however (library bundling issues, integration with JUnit for Spring) that need to be looked at before its really ready for prime time. And getting the Pico Ajax Email / Selenium example working was painful. Please don't release versioned software that depends on snapshot releases of other code!

So, it would be useable on projects if you are willing to spend some time on getting your base class / infrastructure stuff setup. Personally, I like it more than FIT/Fitnesse.
