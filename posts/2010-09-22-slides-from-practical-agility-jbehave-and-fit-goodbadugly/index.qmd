I presented a "Lightning Talk" (6 minutes) at the last Practical Agility meeting on "JBehave and FIT - the Good, the Bad and the Ugly".
For the talk everything was on NEON cards (neon-green, neon-yellow and neon-red! - its all I could find at Walgreens) and before throwing them out thought that I would put them into powerpoint (minus the neon) and share.
Slides are up on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/brianrepko/fit-and-j-behave) - but you might want to download as all the notes are in the notes section.
Enjoy!
