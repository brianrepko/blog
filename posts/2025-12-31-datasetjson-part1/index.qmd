As part of R/Pharma this year, I attended a [workshop](https://atorus-research.github.io/datasetjson_workshop/){target="_blank"} on the CDISC Dataset-JSON standard.
This was a great workshop and props/kudos/flowers to all the folks that put that together.
More recently, CDISC [announced](https://mailchi.mp/cdisc.org/2025bod-12872980?e=d16406719d){target="_blank"} that v1.0 of the API standard is released as well as the supplementary details on compression (aka Compressed Dataset-JSON v1.1).

This later announcement (and some a review of Pilot 5 updates) gives me a chance to dive into this important set of specifications and updates - thus this series.

I'm planning to do an overview in this part 1, go over some potential issues and clarifications in part 2, and then go over the REST API in part 3 (which TBH I've not looked at in detail yet, so it goes last).

## Background

The data sent to regulatory authorities (eg. FDA for USA, EMA for EU, PMDA for Japan, etc.) typically conforms to [CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org){target="_blank"} international standards.
When transferring this (tabular) data - from sponsor to RA - the [SAS V5 XPORT format](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000464.shtml){target="_blank"} (aka "XPT") is currently used (required for the FDA).
XPT was defined in 1989 and its use by the FDA was made official in 1999.
It has many disadvantages - some of which we will highlight below.

Also in 1999, CDISC created the Operational Data Model (ODM).
ODM is a foundational data standard that underlies many of the other CDISC standards and is XML-based.
Between 2000 and 2005, ODM versions 1.0 through 1.3 were released.
Some point releases, ODM v1.3.1 and v1.3.2 were released in 2010 and 2013 respectively.
So from 1999 to 2013, data was defined based on ODM XML foundational standards and still transferred in XPT.

As industry is exploring coding alternatives to SAS - and potentially with sponsors creating all submission materials with R (or without SAS) - other data transfer format alternatives are needed.
Moving to new data transfer standards will also allow CDISC to move beyond the limitations imposed by the XPT format.

Given that ODM was XML-based, in 2012, work was done to create Dataset-XML, with version 1.0 released in 2014.
This is a XML-based data transfer format based on ODM v1.3.2.
However, it was found that Dataset-XML created data files that were quite large (already an issue for XPT) and it was not widely adopted by industry.

Skip ahead ten years, and in 2023, ODM v2.0 was released.
Dataset-XML v1.0 was not updated - it is still an extension of the ODM XML schema (as far as I can tell with a cursory review) and may not need an update.

As part of the ODM v2.0 work, on the data transfer side, Dataset-JSON v1.0 was also released in 2023.
One of the best articles on the need for, development of, and plans for Dataset-JSON is [this one from Sam Hume](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/no-more-xpt-piloting-new-dataset-json-for-fda-submissions-0001){target="_blank"}.

A number of hackathons and pilot projects were done - some issues found - and then Dataset-JSON v1.1 was released in Dec 2024 to address those issues.
Some issues required changes to the specification - some were addressed in the User Guide.
[Here](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Optimizing+the+Use+of+Data+Standards/WP-88+Dataset-JSON+Report.pdf){target="_blank"} is the report, from PHUSE, of those pilot projects.

Lastly, as mentioned above, the Dataset-JSON API v1.0 and Compressed Dataset-JSON v1.1 standards were released a few weeks ago in Dec 2025.


## Dataset-JSON

The Dataset-JSON work actually has multiple components - with a view towards transfer of data via APIs instead of via files.
In particular, this could become part of how sponsors can collect data from various other systems and collaborators - EDCs, CROs, etc.

These components are:

* Dataset-JSON specification and schema ([github repository](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson){target="_blank"})
  * Dataset-JSON v1.1
  * The NDJSON representation of Dataset-JSON
  * Compressed Dataset-JSON v1.1 (aka DSJC)
  * Dataset-JSON schema
  * User's Guide ([cdisc wiki](https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/PUB/Dataset-JSON+v1.1+User%27s+Guide){target="_blank"})

and

* Dataset-JSON API ([github repository](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DataExchange-DatasetJson-API){target="_blank"})
  * Specification as HTML or OpenAPI
  * User's Guide

## Issues with XPT

Anyone that has looked at clinical trial data has wondered why column names are limited to 8 characters - it's XPT.

The data is always tabular (rows and columns).
Columns have name, label / description, type, and length and formatting options.
There is no row identifier (unlike R data.frames) - access, _in SAS_, is via row number (`POINT=`) or via indices defined on top of the data (`KEY=`).

Here is a quick list of issues with XPT v5:

* Column/variable types - only CHARACTER (string) and DOUBLE (numeric - integer or floating point)
* Column names are limited to 8 alphanumeric + `_` characters
* Column labels are limited to 40 characters
* Character values are US ASCII only with max length of 200 characters/bytes
* Character values are stored with padding (so, larger than they need to be)
* Numeric values are stored as IBM hexidecimal floating point (aka HFP, aka IBM-style double) format
  * Which is **NOT** IEEE 754, see  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_hexadecimal_floating-point){target="_blank"}
  * This is why XPT is technically a binary file format - numeric data encoding in the file
* Inability to compress files - leads to data set splitting
* There is no internally stored metadata
  * eg. file metadata, formatting on numerics, padding for characters, date/time formatting, keys

Note that modern versions of SAS use IEEE 754 internally for floating point data - it is only the XPT format that uses the HFP format.
Also note that SAS does support date, time, and datetime variables - these are internally stored as numbers - with datetime point 0 being Jan 1, 1960 00:00:00 UTC.
Actually, I have no idea how timezones work in SAS (all data is UTC and timezone is a system option?).

There is an XPT v8 format as well which made the following changes:

* Column names are extended to 32 characters (case sensitive)
* Column labels are extended to 256 bytes
* Character values are extended 32767 bytes
* It is not clear if US ASCII is still a limitation or not (note the use of bytes vs character limits) - seems like it is limited to US ASCII

In the end, there was not much industry uptake of XPT v8 and efforts were put elsewhere.

## Quick overview of Dataset-JSON

Dataset-JSON is similar to XPT in that it is a single-file for tabular data.

As JSON ([link to html version of spec here](https://cdisc-org.github.io/DataExchange-DatasetJson/doc/dataset-json1-1.html){target="_blank"}), a dataset is a single object.
Dataset metadata are attributes in that object, there is a `columns` array for column definitions, and then a `rows` array-of-arrays for data values.

Column definitions have the following attributes - unique ID (`itemOID`), `name`, `label`, `dataType`, `targetDataType`, `length`, `displayFormat`, and `keySequence`.

Note that `dataType` is the "logical" data type - tied to ODM - with values of `string`, `integer`, `decimal`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`, and `URI`.

The column attribute `targetDataType` is used for some logical types (decimals as strings, date/time/datetime as integers).
We'll discuss this more in part 2.
It looks like boolean values do use JSON `true` and `false` (in other places I've seen these not used in favor of "Y","N" strings).
Missing values are represented with JSON `null`.
The empty string can be a value.

For the NDJSON representation - it is the same as above with the following changes:

* Each line is a JSON object
* Row 1 is a JSON object that is all metadata and column array
* Row 2-n are each an array of data
  * This is basically the `rows` array with "lines" being entries in the array-of-array
  
NDJSON is very useful for streaming large sets of data.

## Next article

In part 2, I'll make a list of some of the issues that come up in reading the specification and how some of the issues found in the pilot were handled.

Overall, I'm thrilled with this effort as it opens up clinical trial data to any programming language AND data transfer via API - but some details need some discussion.
My intent is to highlight and/or clarify points related to data representation (from someone with a whole 30 year career in data engineering) and not to only criticize.

I hope those discussions will get added to the User's Guide or maybe more [pharmaverse blog](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/){target="_blank"} posts (like [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2023-10-30_floating_point/floating_point.html){target="_blank"}, [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2023-09-26_date_functions_and_imputation/date_functions_and_imputation.html){target="_blank"}, and [here](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2023-07-24_rounding/rounding.html){target="_blank"}).
