[![jbehave logo](images/jbehave-logo.png "jbehave-logo")](http://brianrepko.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jbehave-logo.png)JBehave 3.0 was [released](http://jbehave.org/2010/08/31/jbehave-3-0-released/) yesterday (finally!!). I'm thrilled to have donated the Multi-tennant Spring Security example (which has been updated to JBehave 3). That example is now part of the many examples that are included in JBehave. Looking to update the presentation on my website to explain some of the new features that make up JBehave 3.0. Congrats to Mauro and Paul on all their hard work!
